Reducer : A function that manages changes to an object (manages different states)
Used : when we have closely related states
       And we know exactly when to update them
Arguments : called with two object Arguments
            1. object with all our states ({red:0, green:0, blue:0})
            2. object that describes the update ({color:'red', amountToChange: 20})
Technicalities:
            1. We never change Argument 1 directly
            2. Return a value to be used as Argument 1
Either Reducer or useState hook
